### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities. I work in the Salapaka Lab, at the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Iâ€™m advised by Prof. Murti Salapaka. My thesis is on the development of experimental as well as analytical tools needed to model the mechanical properties of proteins at the single molecule scale. This research is at the intersection of system identification, biophysics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning.

Here are quick links to released software:
- [Step Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/SalapakaLab-SIMBioSys/Step-Detection-Algorithm) 
- [Non-Equilibrium Toolbox](https://github.com/SalapakaLab-SIMBioSys/Non-Equilibrium-Toolbox)
